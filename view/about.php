    <p>
        Dragan Constantin, a music composer, embarked on his musical journey at a tender age of 4, enraptured by the melodic tones of the clarinet.
        This instrument swiftly became his solace, an emotional outlet for moments of joy, sorrow, and everything in between.
        Enrolled in the conservatoire at 6, Constantin devoted 12 years to honing his musical prowess.
        His tenure there witnessed him participating in diverse orchestras and bands while delving deep into the realms of music theory and history.

        It was at the age of 10 that he penned his inaugural composition, spurred by his passion for improvisation—translating his impromptu melodies onto paper.
        Though initially a casual pursuit, Constantin earnestly embraced music composition at 15, sparking a ceaseless dedication that spans over 6 years.

        Having navigated through diverse educational paths over the three years following his Baccalauréat (France), he now finds himself immersed in a Bachelor's degree in Digital Engineering program at EFREI Paris, slated for completion in 2025.
        However, his academic ambitions extend beyond this horizon. Driven by an unwavering passion for music composition, his future endeavors are anchored in pursuing advanced studies at the University of Portsmouth.
        There, he aspires to delve into the intricate art of music composition, honing his craft to new heights and broadening his creative horizons.
        This upcoming journey represents a pivotal step toward realizing his aspirations as a seasoned and versatile music composer.
